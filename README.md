## Description

We're making that treacherous leap from SQL databases to the wild west of NoSql databases.

Just kidding. There are plenty of rules, methods, and all kinds of new goodies that I was able to learn about and utilize through MongoDb, Mongoose, and Express. Using these tools, I developed the back-end and RESTful API routes for a basic social media platform.

## Installation

You must have the MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express npm packages installed to run this application. After that, simply cloning and running this from your terminal. 

## Usage

After install all the necessary npm dependencies, you should be able to run the server.js file (via node) to get the server up and running. From there, I used Insomnia to test all of the different routes: GET, UPDATE, and DELETE routes for the Users and their Thoughts (posts), along with POST and DELETE routes for a user's friend list and Reactions (replies) to a user's Thoughts. I have attached a screenshot of the general testing environment setup within Insomnia below.

I also have a walkthrough of testing process [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/myElpkP3WK8agldqNYPn) for you to see what the testing process was like.
